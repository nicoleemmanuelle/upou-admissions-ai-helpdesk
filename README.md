## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Context-Aware AI Helpdesk Assistant** designed to answer inquiries related to the **University of the Philippines Open University (UPOU) Admissions**.

The system uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach to ensure that all responses are:
- ✅ Based on official UPOU documents  
- ✅ Accurate and context-aware  
- ✅ Free from hallucinations  

If the system cannot find the answer in the knowledge base, it will:
- Politely inform the user  
- Offer to create a **support ticket**

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- 💬 Chat-based helpdesk interface  
- 📚 Answers based strictly on official UPOU Admission data  
- ⚠️ Refuses off-topic questions  
- 🧠 Context-aware responses using AWS + OpenAI  
- 🎫 Automatic ticket creation for unanswered queries  
- 🖥️ Deployed on AWS EC2 with public access

## 📚 Knowledge Base

The chatbot uses **10–15 structured documents** related to:
- Admission requirements  
- Application procedures  
- Deadlines  
- FAQs  
- Contact details  

All documents are:
- Stored in **Amazon S3**
- Formatted in **Markdown / CSV**
- Organized by category for efficient retrieval  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works (RAG Flow)

1. User submits a question via the web interface  
2. Request is sent to AWS Lambda  
3. Lambda retrieves relevant documents from S3  
4. Context + question is sent to OpenAI API  
5. AI generates a response based on provided context  
6. Response is returned to the user  

If no relevant data is found:
- A fallback message is returned  
- A ticket is created in DynamoDB  

---

## 🤖 System Prompt Design

The chatbot is guided by a system prompt that ensures:

- It acts as a **professional UPOU helpdesk agent**
- It only answers based on **provided documents**
- It does **not hallucinate**
- It refuses **off-topic questions**
- It provides a **fallback response when unsure**

---

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### 🔹 Prerequisites
- AWS Learner Lab account  
- OpenAI API Key  
- Terraform installed  

---

### 🔹 Steps

#### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/upou-admissions-ai-helpdesk.git
cd upou-admissions-ai-helpdesk
```

#### 2. Setup Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-1
```

#### 3. Deploy Infrastructure (Terraform)
```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

#### 4. Deploy Lambda
- Zip backend files
- Upload to AWS Lambda
- Set handler: `handler.lambda_handler`

#### 5. Run Frontend (EC2)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

---

### 🧪 Testing

The system was tested using:
- ✅ Admission-related queries
- ❌ Off-topic questions (e.g., jokes, cooking)
- ⚠️ Edge cases (missing data, unclear queries)

---

### ⚠️ Error Handling
- Displays loading state during API calls
- Handles API timeouts gracefully
- Returns fallback message if no data is found

---

### 🔐 Security Practices
- No API keys stored in repository
- Uses `.env` for sensitive data
- AWS IAM Role (LabRole) used for permissions
